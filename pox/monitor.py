A skeleton POX component

You can customize this to do whatever you like.  Don't forget to
adjust the Copyright above, and to delete the Apache license if you
don't want to release under Apache (but consider doing so!).

Rename this file to whatever you like, .e.g., mycomponent.py.  You can
then invoke it with "./pox.py mycomponent" if you leave it in the
ext/ directory.

Implement a launch() function (as shown below) which accepts commandline
arguments and starts off your component (e.g., by listening to events).

Edit this docstring and your launch function's docstring.  These will
show up when used with the help component ("./pox.py help --mycomponent").
